Craftmans are observant artisans with an understanding of mechanics and an interest in troubleshooting. They approach their environments with a flexible logic, looking for practical solutions to the problems at hand. They are independent and adaptable, and typically interact with the world around them in a self-directed, spontaneous manner.

Craftmans are attentive to details and responsive to the demands of the world around them. Because of their astute sense of their environment, they are good at moving quickly and responding to emergencies. Craftmans are reserved, but not withdrawn: the Craftman enjoys taking action, and approaches the world with a keen appreciation for the physical and sensory experiences it has to offer.

Craftmans are curious about the mechanics of the world around them and typically have a unique ability to manipulate the tools in their environments. They tend to study how things work and often achieve mastery in the use and operation of machines, instruments, and equipment. They seek understanding, but in a practical sense: they like to be able to put their technical knowledge to immediate use and are quickly bored by theory.

Craftmans tend to be detached and prefer the logic of mechanical things to the complexity of human emotions. Independent and reserved, Craftmans treasure their personal space, and want to be free to be spontaneous and follow their own lead. Craftmans are selective about their relationships, and appreciate others who allow them plenty of freedom to do their own thing.

Craftmans are typically reserved and even aloof. Tolerant and nonjudgmental, the Craftman calmly takes in the details and facts of their surroundings, noticing sensory data and observing how things work. They often tune into what needs to be done, taking care of the immediate needs of the moment in a modest, inconspicuous way. They tend to prefer action to conversation, and are often private about their personal lives. Craftmans are unlikely to “open up” to new people in a conventional way, but may connect with others by sharing an activity or working together to solve a practical problem.

Craftmans are good with their hands and often mechanical. They are typically attracted to hands-on hobbies like woodworking or crafts, and may be found tinkering with bicycles, computers, cars, or household appliances. They often have an intuitive understanding of machines and a remarkable ability to fix things. Craftmans have an appreciation for risk and action, and often enjoy thrilling leisure activities like extreme sports, motorcycling, or weaponry.

Craftmans are often reserved communicators, preferring action to conversation. They like to do what needs to be done and may grow impatient with discussion that does not turn quickly to action. They are often observant, picking up on details of the current situation, and evaluate information in a detached and logical way. Typically flexible and tolerant, the Craftman is ready to adapt to the situation at hand, but can be bluntly critical if they see inefficiency or incompetence.

In relationships, the Craftman is independent and calm. They are often handy around the house, and enjoy being useful to their partners as quick and able problem-solvers.

Craftmans are fun-loving and adventurous, and will often encourage their partners to learn new and exciting physical skills. They are good at responding to their partners’ immediate physical needs, but may be less adept at dealing with emotions. Craftmans are natural troubleshooters, but look for logical, practical solutions to problems; more complex personal issues may leave them stumped.

Often private, the Craftman tends to keep their feelings and reactions to themselves. For the Craftman, this is not about withholding: they simply prefer to move on to the next activity rather than dwell on their emotional experience. Craftmans understand the temporary nature of their emotions, and rarely find them an interesting topic of conversation.

Craftmans are unlikely to offer flowery speeches or romantic overtures, and are more likely to show affection by being of practical service to their partners. They want their partners to appreciate their skills in getting things done, and to allow them plenty of freedom to do their own thing.

As parents, Craftmans often connect with their children through their mechanical and physical skills, first by teaching their children, and then by enjoying an activity together. Craftmans are rarely demonstrative or particularly verbal, and may show their love to their families by crafting or building something for them rather than being outwardly affectionate. Craftmans are generous and helpful but sometimes unreliable, and may become distracted from family responsibilities when adventure is at hand.
