Directors are hardworking traditionalists, eager to take charge in organizing projects and people. Orderly, rule-abiding, and conscientious, Directors like to get things done, and tend to go about projects in a systematic, methodical way.

Directors are the consummate organizers, and want to bring structure to their surroundings. They value predictability and prefer things to proceed in a logical order. When they see a lack of organization, the Director often takes the initiative to establish processes and guidelines, so that everyone knows what's expected.

Directors are conventional, factual, and grounded in reality. For the Director, the proof is in the past: what has worked and what has been done before. They value evidence over conjecture, and trust their personal experience. Directors look for rules to follow and standards to meet, and often take a leadership role in helping other people meet expectations as well. They concern themselves with maintaining the social order and keeping others in line.

Directors often take on a project manager role at home as well as at work, and excel at setting goals, making decisions, and organizing resources to accomplish a task. The Director wants to achieve efficient productivity and typically believes this is best accomplished when people and systems are well organized.

Directors command a situation, with the sense that they know how things should go and are ready to take charge to make sure that it happens. They are task-oriented and put work before play. Confident and tough-minded, the Director appears almost always to be in control. Directors appreciate structure and often begin to organize as soon as they enter a room. They want to establish the ground rules and make sure everyone does what they’re supposed to.

Directors are often involved in institutions: clubs, associations, societies, and churches, where they usually take a leadership role. They typically connect with others through sharing ritual and routine. Social interaction for Directors often means following an established tradition to engage with others in a structured way. Directors tend to respect and seek out hierarchy. They want to know who’s in charge, and will assign levels of responsibility if none exist. Once a structure is in place, Directors typically trust authority figures and expect obedience from people of lower rank.

Directors are practical, action-oriented communicators. They often assume control and communicate to organize and determine what needs to be done. Directors are clear about expectations and procedures; they explain the necessary steps as well as how and when tasks should be completed. They are open to debate and criticism, but want rules to be followed and work to get done. They are focused on tasks and results and have little patience for deviation or nonconformity.

In relationships, the Director is dependable, responsible, and opinionated. Directors appreciate routine and family traditions, and want stability and security in their home life. They tend to have very structured lives and organized homes.

Directors can be domineering, and often want to dictate schedules and procedures for the people around them. Decisive and strong-willed, they are sometimes impatient with their partners' feelings. They may need to work on relaxing control and opening the lines of communication.

Directors want a relationship they can rely on, and one that helps them live out their ideals of a traditional home life. Directors value a partner who appreciates their responsibility and productivity, and one who notices the Director’s tangible contributions to the relationship.

As parents, Directors insist on clear roles and expectations. They emphasize respect for authority and for the rules of the household. Director parents often take control of the family and assign jobs and duties to family members, expecting that these roles be carried out without complaint.

Directors are traditionalists with a strong appreciation for holidays, ceremonies, and cultural occasions, and often connect with their children through established rituals. The Director’s ultimate goal in parenting is to raise their children to be hardworking, productive, and observant of the rules and expectations of society.
