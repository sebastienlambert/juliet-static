Achievers are energetic thrillseekers who are at their best when putting out fires, whether literal or metaphorical. They bring a sense of dynamic energy to their interactions with others and the world around them. They assess situations quickly and move adeptly to respond to immediate problems with practical solutions.

Active and playful, Achievers are often the life of the party and have a good sense of humor. They use their keen powers of observation to assess their audience and adapt quickly to keep interactions exciting. Although they typically appear very social, they are rarely sensitive; the Achiever prefers to keep things fast-paced and silly rather than emotional or serious.

Achievers are often natural athletes; they easily navigate their physical environment and are typically highly coordinated. They like to use this physical aptitude in the pursuit of excitement and adventure, and they often enjoy putting their skills to the test in risky or even dangerous activities.

The Achiever's focus is action in the moment. They are engaged with their environments and solve practical problems quickly. Achievers are excellent in emergencies, when they can apply their logical reasoning to situations where immediate action is necessary. Long-term goals are less interesting to the Achiever, who prefers to see tangible results in the moment.

The first thing you notice about the Achiever is likely to be their energy. They’re often chatting, joking, and flirting with friends and strangers alike. They enjoy engaging playfully with others and amusing everyone around them with their irreverent sense of humor. They tend to keep people on their toes, never quite knowing what the Achiever will poke fun at next. Achievers are unabashedly gregarious with people, but their interest in individuals may not last long; they are more likely to work a room, having a laugh with everyone, than they are to engage in depth with any one person.

Achievers are comfortable in their physical environment and always looking for some action or activity. They tend to be the most naturally coordinated of all the types and are often found playing sports or engaging in various physical activities, especially ones with an element of danger. They are the stereotypical “adrenaline junkies” and may be found skydiving, motorcycle racing, or enjoying other extreme sports.

Achievers tend to be persuasive, energetic communicators. They quickly observe the realities of the present situation and engage others to take action on practical problems. Many Achievers speak very freely, and can be blunt and impatient in getting their message across. They may not want to wait for someone else to buy in before they can act. The Achiever may come off as charming, and many Achievers are masters at negotiating with others so that they can achieve their goals in the most efficient way possible.

In relationships, the Achiever is fun-loving and pragmatic. Hedonistic and flirtatious, Achiever partners tend to keep things exciting. They are often pursuing adventure and like a playmate who will come along for the ride.

Achievers tend to have little patience for serious discussions or emotional exploration, preferring to keep things fun and action-packed. They tend to be attentive to their partners’ physical needs, but may neglect the deeper emotional connections. Serious discussions about feelings rarely hold much appeal for the thrillseeking Achiever.

Achievers are enthusiastic and reasonable problem-solvers. However, their orientation toward quick thinking may lead them to try to apply a solution before they fully understand the issues involved in a conflict, especially when complex and difficult emotions are involved.

Achievers want a partner that will appreciate their practicality and willingness to get their hands dirty, and allow them plenty of freedom to pursue excitement.

As parents, Achievers often connect with their children through a shared appreciation for activity and spontaneity. Achievers are often as interested and curious about the world as their children are, and will encourage their children to engage physically and take risks.

Achiever parents are less patient with timid or sensitive children, and may want their children to be hardy and thick-skinned. They may not have much interest in quiet moments or emotional discussions. They enjoy seeing their children succeed, especially in athletic or competitive pursuits, and will often play the role of enthusiastic coach.
