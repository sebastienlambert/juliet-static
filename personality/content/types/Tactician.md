Tacticians are steady, productive contributors.

When given something to do, they are highly dependable, and follow it through to the end.

Tacticians are resoundingly logical and can be stubborn once they've decided on the best course of action. They usually like things done their way. Often the "proper" course of action is self-evident to the Tactician, who may have little patience with unconventional approaches.

Tacticians tend to work hard to ensure that their families are provided for and that they are living up to their own expectations of what a good partner should be. They are typically most satisfed with a partner who can recognize and appreciate the hard work they put in to contribute to the household.

As parents, Tacticians are firm in their expectations and consistent in enforcing rules. They rarely dote on their children, but provide stability, structure, and the practical necessities of life.

Tactician parents want to pass on traditions and teach their children how to fit into society. They expect their children to be as dutiful as they are, and concern themselves with teaching their children to work hard, respect authority, and care for their material possessions.
