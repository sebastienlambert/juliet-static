Entertainers are vivacious entertainers who charm and engage those around them. They are spontaneous, energetic, and fun-loving, and take pleasure in the things around them: food, clothes, nature, animals, and especially people.

Entertainers are typically warm and talkative and have a contagious enthusiasm for life. They like to be in the middle of the action and the center of attention. They have a playful, open sense of humor, and like to draw out other people and help them have a good time.

Entertainers live in the moment, enjoying what life has to offer. They are especially tuned into their senses and take pleasure in the sights, sounds, smells, and textures around them. Entertainers like to keep busy, filling their lives with hobbies, sports, activities, and friends. Because they'd rather live spontaneously than plan ahead, they can become overextended when there are too many exciting things to do. An Entertainer hates nothing more than missing out on the fun.

Although they are characteristically fun-loving, Entertainers are also typically practical and down-to-earth. They are grounded in reality and are usually keenly aware of the facts and details in their environment, especially as they pertain to people. They are observant of others and their needs, and responsive in offering assistance. Entertainers enjoy helping other people, especially in practical, tangible ways.

Entertainers are often the life of the party, entertaining and engaging others with humor and enthusiasm. They notice whether other people are having fun, and do their best to create a good time for all. Typically at home in their physical environment, Entertainers may take the lead in getting everyone involved in some active diversion. Entertainers are generally friendly and likable, but can be hard to get close to; although they tend to be very open, they are reluctant to be serious or to talk about anything negative.

Entertainers are tuned into their senses, and often gravitate towards pleasing colors and textures in their environments. They often carefully choose fabrics and decorations with which to surround themselves. This attention also often translates into their appearance; Entertainers are often dressed in sensuous fabrics or bright, dazzling colors. They are often up on the latest trends, and like to excite the people around them with new environments and experiences.

Entertainers are enthusiastic, light-hearted communicators. They often love just interacting with people, with no particular goal in mind, and tend to keep conversations fun and full of laughter. Entertainers are free with compliments and energy, and and often draw people in with their positive approach and ability to observe other people’s needs. Entertainers are good problem-solvers when it comes to practical and interpersonal issues, but they tend to avoid negativity; discussions that turn to criticism or conflict will send the Entertainer running.

In relationships, the Entertainer is generous, friendly, sympathetic, and affectionate. Entertainers are eager to please their partners and motivated to create a fun, harmonious, and active home. They often enjoy family life tremendously and typically prioritize socializing with loved ones above all else.

Entertainers tend to avoid conflict and may have trouble being serious, preferring to move on with their active lives rather than have an uncomfortable discussion. They are tuned into the needs of the people around them, but prefer to do something constructive to take care of their loved ones, rather than spend time hashing out difficult issues.

Entertainers are supportive of their mates and try to take good care of their families, but can be impulsive as they pursue the pleasures of life. They may go where the wind blows and neglect to follow up on responsibilities. They are characteristically spontaneous and usually dislike a structured lifestyle.

Entertainers want a partner who supports them in their lifelong pursuit of fun and excitement. An ideal mate for an Entertainer is affectionate and appreciative of the Entertainer’s generosity and desire to be helpful to others.

As parents, Entertainers are loving, affectionate, and fun, and usually like to have their households full of people having a good time. They may have many children, and are good at responding to their families' practical needs.

Entertainers may be a bit unpredictable or scattered, and will prefer to engage everyone in a fun activity rather than impose rules or discipline. They do not tend to take life seriously, and often consider it more important to provide excitement and fun than to create structure or stability for their children.
