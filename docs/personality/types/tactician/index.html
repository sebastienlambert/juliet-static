    <h1 class="title"> Tactician </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Tacticians are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do. Reliable and dutiful, Tacticians want to uphold tradition and follow regulations.</p>

<p>Tacticians are steady, productive contributors. Although they are Introverted, Tacticians are rarely isolated; typical Tacticians know just where they belong in life, and want to understand how they can participate in established organizations and systems. They concern themselves with maintaining the social order and making sure that standards are met.</p>

<p>Tacticians like to know what the rules of the game are, valuing predictability more than imagination. They rely on their past experience to guide them, and are most comfortable in familiar surroundings. Tacticians trust the proven method, and appreciate the value of dedicated practice to build confidence in their skills.</p>

<p>Tacticians are hardworking and will persist until a task is done. They are logical and methodical, and often enjoy tasks that require them to use step-by-step reasoning to solve a problem. They are meticulous in their attention to details, and examine things closely to be sure they are correct. With their straightforward logic and orientation to detail, Tacticians work systematically to bring order to their own small parts of the world.</p>

<p>Tacticians have a serious, conservative air about them. They want to know and follow the rules of the game, and typically seek out predictable surroundings where they understand their role. You may find the Tactician doing something useful even in social situations (for instance, organizing coats and hats at a party) as they’re often more comfortable taking charge of a task than they are chatting up strangers. When given something to do, they are highly dependable, and follow it through to the end.</p>

<p>Tacticians are practical and no-nonsense, and rarely call attention to themselves. Their clothes and possessions tend to be chosen based on utility rather than fashion, and they have an affection for the classics. Tacticians typically speak in a straightforward manner and have a good head for details. They are usually more enthusiastic about sharing factual information than exploring abstract concepts or unproven ideas</p>

<p>Tacticians communicate in a direct and straightforward way. They are specific and oriented to details, and often communicate primarily to move a task along. The Tactician typically has a great memory for detail and has a vast storehouse of practical, factual information. Most Tacticians don’t talk for the sake of talking, but will share their knowledge when they see a practical need for it. Tacticians are often no-nonsense and action-oriented in their communication; they tell what they know and what needs to be done.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Tactician is loyal and reliable. Tacticians have a strong respect for tradition and often assume typical gender roles in their relationships, with male Tacticians taking on the role of provider and female Tacticians caring for home and family. Tacticians value stability, and tend to appreciate relationships that they can count on over the long term. They keep their promises and expect others to do the same.</p>

<p>Tacticians are resoundingly logical and can be stubborn once they&rsquo;ve decided on the best course of action. They usually like things done their way. Often the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; course of action is self-evident to the Tactician, who may have little patience with unconventional approaches.</p>

<p>Tacticians tend to work hard to ensure that their families are provided for and that they are living up to their own expectations of what a good partner should be. They are typically most satisfed with a partner who can recognize and appreciate the hard work they put in to contribute to the household.</p>

<p>As parents, Tacticians are firm in their expectations and consistent in enforcing rules. They rarely dote on their children, but provide stability, structure, and the practical necessities of life. They may be strict and often emphasize traditional values like responsibility, loyalty, and obedience.</p>

<p>Tactician parents want to pass on traditions and teach their children how to fit into society. They expect their children to be as dutiful as they are, and concern themselves with teaching their children to work hard, respect authority, and care for their material possessions.</p>
