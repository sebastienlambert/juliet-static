    <h1 class="title"> Captain </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Captains are strategic leaders, motivated to organize change. They are quick to see inefficiency and conceptualize new solutions, and enjoy developing long-range plans to accomplish their vision. They excel at logical reasoning and are usually articulate and quick-witted.</p>

<p>Captains are analytical and objective, and like bringing order to the world around them. When there are flaws in a system, the Captain sees them, and enjoys the process of discovering and implementing a better way. Captains are assertive and enjoy taking charge; they see their role as that of leader and manager, organizing people and processes to achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Captains are often very motivated by success in their careers and enjoy hard work. They are ambitious and interested in gaining power and influence. To the Captain, decision-making is a vocation. They want to be in a position to make the call and put plans into motion.</p>

<p>Captains tend to be blunt and decisive. Driven to get things done, they can sometimes be critical or brusque in the pursuit of a goal. They are typically friendly and outgoing, although they may not pick up on emotional subleties in other people. They often love working with others toward a common goal, but may not find time to attend to their feelings. They are focused on results and want to be productive, competent, and influential.</p>

<p>Captains are natural leaders, and often take charge no matter where they are. They typically have a clear vision for the future, and intuitively understand how to move people and processes towards that goal. They tend to approach every situation with the attitude of an efficiency analyst, and are not shy about pointing out what could be done better. For the Captain, their ideas are a foregone conclusion: it’s just a matter of time before they can move the players to get everything accomplished.</p>

<p>Captains are often gregarious, and seem to have an idea for how a person will fit into their grand scheme from the moment they are introduced. They are typically direct and may seem presumptuous or even arrogant; they size people and situations up very quickly, and have trouble being anything but honest about what they see. Captains are sensitive to issues of power, and seek positions and people of influence. They are characeristically ambitious, and often very engaged in their careers. More than any other type, Captains enjoy their work, and may even say that working is what they do for fun.</p>

<p>Captains are direct and commanding communicators, often with a clear idea of what needs to be done and and a take-charge attitude toward organizing people and projects. Captains are organized and strategic in their thinking. They communicate their vision and their plan to implement it in a logical, task-oriented way. Captains see flaw in ideas and plans quickly and give critique freely. They enjoy analyzing ideas, but are ultimately oriented toward action; they want to integrate information, formulate a long-term plan, and then move forward.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Captain is a commanding and challenging partner. Captains have high expectations for themselves and for their partners, and want a mate who will put in the time and effort necessary to create a successful life together.</p>

<p>Captains prefer to have their homes and lives structured and organized, and may be domineering in imposing this structure on others. They tend to have a clear idea of how things should be done, and may feel that others should follow.</p>

<p>Captains are enthusiastic and analytical problem-solvers, and will approach conflict head-on. They are unemotional in sorting out issues, and weigh perspectives with a logical detachment. They may neglect to attend to their partner&rsquo;s feelings, preferring to arrive at conclusions with objective logic. They can also have trouble listening patiently, because of their strong desire to problem-solve.</p>

<p>Captains are typically ambitious and may spend a lot of time at work or otherwise pursuing career success. They often need a partner who is independent and supportive of their goals. Captains value a partner who respects and appreciates their competence, intelligence, and effectiveness.</p>

<p>As parents, Captains are in control of their children and their households. Captains set clear expectations and see that their rules are followed. They tend to be consistent and rational disciplinarians by setting clear consequences for misbehavior, and usually elicit obedience from their children.</p>

<p>Captains often have a strong focus on career, and so may spend limited time at home and with family. However, they place great importance on the task of being a competent and effective parent. They often ensure that what time they do spend with their children is well used, and allows them to instill values of hard work, productivity, and achievement.</p>
