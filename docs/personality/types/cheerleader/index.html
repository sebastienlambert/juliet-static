    <div class="content"> <p>Cheerleaders are people-centered creators with a focus on possibilities and a contagious enthusiasm for new ideas, people and activities. Energetic, warm, and passionate, Cheerleaders love to help other people explore their creative potential.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders are typically agile and expressive communicators, using their wit, humor, and mastery of language to create engaging stories. Imaginative and original, Cheerleaders often have a strong artistic side. They are drawn to art because of its ability to express inventive ideas and create a deeper understanding of human experience.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders tend to be curious about others and preoccupied with discovering the deeper meaning in people and ideas. They want authentic experience and often seek emotional intensity. Cheerleaders are easily bored by details and repetition and seek out situations that offer an escape from the mundane. Novelty is attractive to Cheerleaders, who often have a wide range of interests and friends from many backgrounds.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders prize individuality and often consider the pursuit of happiness to be the highest priority in life, both for themselves and for others. They place great importance on personal freedom and self-expression, and want to be able to go wherever inspiration leads.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders love to talk about people: not just the facts, but what motivates them, what inspires them, and what they envision achieving in life. They’ll often share their own aspirations freely, and want to hear others’ in return. The Cheerleader is unlikely to judge anyone’s dream, and will discuss the most imaginative and outlandish of fantasies with warm, enthusiastic intensity. They love to explore creative possibilities, and nothing deflates them faster than talking about dry facts or harsh reality.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders often seem unconventional, and may come off as scattered; they don’t tend to be in touch with their physical surroundings. They often overlook the details, as they are more likely to focus on connecting with other people or on exploring their own imagination and self-expression. They have little patience for the mundane and want to experience life with intensity and flair. Cheerleaders often have an artistic streak, and may be artistic in appearance. Many have developed a distinctive and quirky personal style.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders are enthusiastic, collaborative communicators who love exploring possibilites for people. They often enjoy getting to know other people and understanding what inspires them, and they are insightful about solutions to personal problems. Highly empathic, the Cheerleader can find something to identify with in almost every person they meet, and enjoys encouraging other people to develop and grow. Cheerleaders are typically optimistic and like to talk about opportunities for the future, motivating others to join them in their vision.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Cheerleader is warm, encouraging, and emotionally engaged. Cheerleaders connect with others by sharing their feelings and experiences. They are expressive with their mates and want their mates to share openly with them.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders place great importance on personal development; they encourage their mates to pursue their dreams and want the same encouragement back. They are accepting of their partners as individuals and are unlikely to pressure their partners into being or doing anything in particular. On the rare occasion that they object to a mate&rsquo;s behavior, it&rsquo;s likely to be because their values have been violated.</p>

<p>Although they are quite sensitive, Cheerleaders can be guarded when it comes to their deepest feelings. They dislike conflict and are likely to withdraw rather than engage in a difficult discussion. Cheerleaders are flexible and supportive, and would rather find a way to connect than butt heads. They are creative problem-solvers, and can often come up with original ways to compromise.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders can sometimes be unpredictable, as they follow their inspiration wherever it leads. They can seem unreliable, although they are usually very responsive when a partner is emotionally in need. The ideal mate for an Cheerleader supports their creativity and caring for others, and expresses appreciation for the Cheerleader&rsquo;s unique qualities openly and often.</p>

<p>As parents, Cheerleaders are creative and devoted. They enjoy creating new experiences for their families and want to inspire their children to grow as individuals. Although they can be very passionate in their ideas about correct behavior, they are not often strong disciplinarians; they value close relationships above all else and may avoid discipline for fear that it will distance them from their children.</p>

<p>Cheerleaders deeply value their role as parents. However, they tire quickly when subjected to mundane chores and demands from their children. They get the most joy out of parenting when they are connecting emotionally with their children and joining them to explore possibilities for the future.</p>
