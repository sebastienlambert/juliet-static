    <div class="content"> <p>Philosophers are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see. They want to understand the unifying themes of life, in all their complexity.</p>

<p>Philosophers are detached, analytical observers who can seem oblivious to the world around them because they are so deeply absorbed in thought. They spend much of their time focused internally: exploring concepts, making connections, and seeking understanding. To the Architect, life is an ongoing inquiry into the mysteries of the universe.</p>

<p>Philosophers present a cool exterior but are privately passionate about reason, analysis, and innovation. They seek to create complex systems of understanding to unify the principles they&rsquo;ve observed in their environments. Their minds are complicated and active, and they will go to great mental lengths trying to devise ingenious solutions to interesting problems.</p>

<p>The Philosopher is typically non-traditional, and more likely to reason out their own individual way of doing things than to follow the crowd. The Philosopher is suspicious of assumptions and conventions, and eager to break apart ideas that others take for granted. Philosophers are merciless when analyzing concepts and beliefs, and hold little sacred. They are often baffled by other people who remain loyal to ideology that doesn&rsquo;t make logical sense.</p>

<p>Philosophers are often thoroughly engaged in their own thoughts, and usually appear to others to be offbeat and unconventional. The Philosopher’s mind is a most active place, and their inward orientation can mean that they neglect superficial things like home décor or appropriate clothing. They don’t tend to bother with small talk but can become downright passionate when talking about science, mathematics, computers, or the larger theoretical problems of the universe. Reality is often of only passing interest to the Architect, as they are more interested in the theory behind it all.</p>

<p>Philosophers are typically precise in their speech, and communicate complex ideas with carefully chosen words. They insist on intellectual rigor in even the most casual of conversations, and will readily point out inconsistencies of thought or reasoning. Social niceties may fall by the wayside for an Philosopher who is more interested in analyzing logic, and they may offend others by submitting their dearly held values and beliefs to logical scrutiny.</p>

<p>Philosophers can be insightful communicators, when the subject inspires them. Thoughtful and independent, they may not have a great need for conversation, but when discussing complex concepts or innovative ideas they can become quite intense and display a wealth of information and insight. Logical and analytical, they can weigh possibilities endlessly and are great at playing devil’s advocate. They love to pick apart ideas but are not convinced by anything but the most rational of analyses; they can spot a flaw in logic a mile away, and rarely hesitate to point it out.</p>

<p>Philosophers are independent and clever partners. They enjoy engaging intellectually and want an intelligent partner who can match their ability to think critically.</p>

<p>Philosophers have little appetite for the mundane aspects of life, and may disregard the usual rituals of a relationship. They are rarely interested in tradition, preferring instead to design a lifestyle that makes sense for the parties involved—even if it looks highly unconventional to other people. They are tolerant of individual preferences but will rarely do something because they are told they &ldquo;should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philosophers tend to analyze the theory behind everything, and may interpret human interactions with the detached logic of a psychological researcher. They may find others difficult to deal with when they cannot understand the logic behind their behavior. When things get too emotional, they may retreat to their own world of thoughts and ideas.</p>

<p>Philosophers want plenty of space in a relationship to explore their own thoughts, ideas, and interests. They value a partner that appreciates their ingenuity and problem-solving ability, and one that understands their need for autonomy.</p>

<p>As parents, Philosophers encourage competence and independent problem solving. They often do not tune in easily to their children&rsquo;s feelings, but will enthusiastically help them to reason out a complex dilemma.</p>

<p>Philosophers are usually involved in their own projects or ideas and typically do not take much pleasure in the mundane, day-to-day tasks of caring for children. As a result, the Architect parent may sometimes seem distant to their children, but their true delight in parenting is in sharing exciting ideas and concepts with young minds.</p>
