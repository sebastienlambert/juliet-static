    <div class="content"> <p>Optimists are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and beliefs. To a Healer, possibilities are paramount; the realism of the moment is only of passing concern. They see potential for a better future, and pursue truth and meaning with their own individual flair.</p>

<p>Optimists are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned with the personal growth of themselves and others. Individualistic and nonjudgmental, Optimists believe that each person must find their own path. They enjoy spending time exploring their own ideas and values, and are gently encouraging to others to do the same. Optimists are creative and often artistic; they enjoy finding new outlets for self-expression.</p>

<p>Optimists value authenticity and want to be original and individual in what they do. They are often concerned with a search for meaning and truth within themselves. Following tradition holds little appeal for the Optimist; they prefer to do their own exploration of values and ideas, and decide for themselves what seems right. Optimists are often offbeat and unconventional, but they feel no desire to conform. The Optimist would rather be true to themselves than try to fit in with the crowd.</p>

<p>Optimists are accepting and nonjudgmental in their treatment of others, believing that each person must follow their own path. They are flexible and accommodating, and can often see many points of view. It is important to the Optimist to support other people; however, the Optimist may react strongly if they feel their own values are being violated. They especially hate being steamrolled by people who insist there is one right way to do things. Optimists want an open, supportive exchange of ideas.</p>

<p>Optimists may initially seem cool, as they reserve their most authentic thoughts and feelings for people they know well. They are reflective and often spiritual, and often interested in having meaningful conversations about values, ethics, people, and personal growth. Typically curious and open-minded, the Healer continually seeks a deeper understanding of themselves and of the people around them. They are passionate about their ideals, but private as well; few people understand the depth of the Optimist’s commitment to their beliefs.</p>

<p>Optimists are sensitive and empathetic, and engage themselves in a lifelong quest for meaning and authenticity. The mundane aspects of life are of less interest to this type, and they are more excited by interesting ideas than by practical facts. They typically accept others without question, and may take special interest in offbeat points of view or alternative lifestyles. They often have a special affection for the arts, especially the avant garde, as they love experiencing new concepts in self-expression.</p>

<p>Optimists are gentle, encouraging communicators who enjoy exploring options and ideas. They envision possibilities for people and are often good at coming up with creative, flexible solutions to problems. They are typically attentive listeners who try to adapt their communication style to the people they are dealing with. Compassionate and cooperative, they tend to be appreciative of other people and their ideas, although they may be reserved about sharing their own closely held values and ideas with people they do not know well.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Optimist is nurturing, empathic, and loyal. Healers select their friends and partners carefully, looking for a strong bond and congruent values. They are self-aware and often spiritual.</p>

<p>Optimists tend to be open-minded and accepting of another&rsquo;s behavior and preferences, so long as their core values are not violated. They support their partners&rsquo; individuality, and encourage them to explore their interests and ideas.</p>

<p>Optimists look for ways to compromise and accommodate other people, and often have creative solutions to interpersonal problems. They can be very sensitive, but often keep negative reactions to themselves because they are reluctant to engage in confrontation.</p>

<p>Close and harmonious relationships are important to Optimists, although they also need a lot of independent time to think and reflect. They often want plenty of freedom to express themselves and pursue greater self-awareness. They value a partner who is committed and loving, yet provides them with the support they need to independently explore the mysteries of life.</p>

<p>As parents, Optimists are caring, supportive, and adaptable. They rarely establish a strict or structured household, preferring instead to address problems and situations as they arise. They often allow their children a lot of latitude and influence in making decisions, and may leave the creation and enforcement of household rules up to another parent.</p>

<p>Children of Optimists often find that they have the freedom to express themselves and make their own decisions until they violate their Optimist parent&rsquo;s values. When values are in question, the Healer parent becomes firm and inflexible.</p>
