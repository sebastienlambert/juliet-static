    <h1 class="title"> Diplomat </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Diplomats are conscientious helpers, sensitive to the needs of others and energetically dedicated to their responsibilities. They are highly attuned to their emotional environment and attentive to both the feelings of others and the perception others have of them. Diplomats like a sense of harmony and cooperation around them, and are eager to please and provide.</p>

<p>Diplomats value loyalty and tradition, and usually make their family and friends their top priority. They are generous with their time, effort, and emotions. They often take on the concerns of others as if they were their own, and will attempt to put their significant organizational talents to use to bring order to other people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

<p>Diplomats act according to a strict moral code, and look for others to do the same. They often see things in terms of black and white, right and wrong, and they are typically not shy about sharing their evaluations of others&rsquo; behavior. Diplomats seek harmony and cooperation, and feel this is best accomplished when everyone follows the same set of rules. They have a sense of order in the way people relate to one another, and often take on roles that allow them to help enforce that social order.</p>

<p>Diplomats feel a sense of personal responsibility for other people&rsquo;s needs, and are usually eager to get involved and help out. They tend to be serious and practical, dutifully putting business before pleasure—especially the business of caring for others. They typically enjoy routine and often keep a regular schedule that allows them to be organized and productive.</p>

<p>Diplomats may often be found playing host or hostess. They tend to take on the role of organizer without hesitation, and want to be sure that everyone is taken care of. Roles such as committee leader, event planner, and church volunteer suit the Diplomat well. They are typically engaged with their communities and work hard to do their part in maintaining the social order. Diplomats are interested in other people and like to know the details of their lives. Gossip is a favorite pasttime of many Diplomats; they love to share stories about the people around them.</p>

<p>Diplomats have a clear moral code that guides their behavior and their expectations from others. They often have strong opinions about how people should behave and the proper thing to do. Manners and other codes of social interaction are often of great interest to Diplomats. They may think in terms of black and white, right and wrong. They can be judgmental of others who they do not think are acting appropriately, but they have the best of intentions: they simply want everyone to follow the rules so they can all get along. The Diplomat wants things to be all right with the people around them, and may become very involved with others’ problems and concerns.</p>

<p>Diplomats are enthusiastic and caring communicators, who want to engage people to contribute and accomplish what needs to be done. They tend to be friendly and to get along easily with others, although they can become frustrated with those who do not respond to their attempts to reach out. They have a good memory for detail, especially facts about other people, and enjoy getting to know people and understanding their needs. Diplomats are factual in their communication, but generally uncomfortable with criticism and conflict, preferring instead to provide support and encouragement to others.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Diplomat is supportive, nurturing, and reliable. Diplomats concern themselves with providing practical support to their partners and living up to traditional standards in a relationship: they want to be the &ldquo;good wife&rdquo; or husband based on traditional ideals.</p>

<p>Diplomats like an organized life and want their partners to participate in a structured, scheduled lifestyle. They adhere strictly to their own moral code, and want a partner who agrees with them on issues of right and wrong, should and should not. Conscientiousness is important to the Diplomat, and when they follow through responsibly on their promises, they expect the same from others.</p>

<p>Diplomats dislike conflict and are motivated to resolve it quickly. They prefer stable, harmonious relationships and like a partner who is able to be loving and committed, even when the Diplomat has strong emotional reactions. Diplomats appreciate a partner who notices their efforts to provide for their families, and commends them on a job well done.</p>

<p>As parents, Diplomats provide clear structure and loving boundaries. They are interested in providing a safe and stable home with adequate resources, and in instilling a strong moral code and work ethic into their children. They are extremely devoted to their children, and go to tremendous lengths to be sure they are provided for.</p>

<p>Diplomats often strongly identify with their children’s behavior, feeling tremendous pride when they succeed but an enormous sense of personal failure when they do not. Diplomats may become embarrassed and critical of children who do not behave as expected; they want their children to adopt and follow their own strong system of values.</p>
