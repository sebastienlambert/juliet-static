    <h1 class="title"> Artist </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Artists are gentle caretakers who live in the present moment and enjoy their surroundings with cheerful, low-key enthusiasm. They are flexible and spontaneous, and like to go with the flow to enjoy what life has to offer. Artists are quiet and unassuming, and may be hard to get to know. However, to those who know them well, the Artist is warm and friendly, eager to share in life&rsquo;s many experiences.</p>

<p>Artists have a strong aesthetic sense and seek out beauty in their surroundings. They are attuned to sensory experience, and often have a natural talent for the arts. Artists especially excel at manipulating objects, and may wield creative tools like paintbrushes and sculptor&rsquo;s knives with great mastery.</p>

<p>Artists tend to be tolerant and nonjudgmental, but are deeply loyal to the people and causes that matter to them. They endeavor to accept and support other people, but are ultimately guided by their own core values. They will typically look for ways to be accommodating and may have difficulty dealing with others who are not willing to do the same.</p>

<p>Artists are typically modest and may underestimate themselves. They usually do not like to be in the spotlight, preferring instead to take a supporting role, and will avoid planning and organizing whenever possible. Sensitive and responsive, they step in to do what needs to be done and are satisfied by their personal sense of being helpful to others.</p>

<p>Artists can be difficult to recognize because of their tendency to express themselves through action rather than words. They may initially appear distant or aloof, but if you watch closely, you can observe their caring in the thoughtful things they do for others. They are carefully observant of the practical needs of other people, and often step in with quiet, unassuming assistance at just the moment it is needed. Artists prefer to take a supportive role and are rarely assertive or demanding of attention. They are typically tolerant and accepting of others.</p>

<p>Artists typically have finely tuned artistic sensibilities. They are sensitive to color, texture, and tone, and often have an innate sense of what will be aesthetically pleasing. They are often naturals when it comes to arranging something artistically, and enjoy the process of taking in the sensations around them. Artists focus mostly on the experiences of the present moment, and are rarely ambitious, preferring instead to enjoy the simple pleasures of life: friends, family, and sensory delights such as food, music, and art.</p>

<p>Artists are gentle, accepting communicators who tend to follow the flow of conversation and look for opportunities to contribute with factual information or practical help. They are easygoing and supportive; they don’t want to be in control or attract attention, and are often attentive listeners. Considerate and accepting, the Artist often looks for common ground with others. Artists shy away from conflict or criticism, preferring harmonious, spontaneous interactions that allow them to be helpful and kind.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Artist is loyal, patient, and easygoing. Artists are eager to help and quickly perceive the needs of their partners and families. They often show affection with simple, practical gestures that make their loved ones feel comfortable and well taken care of.</p>

<p>Artists like to maintain harmony and are very reluctant to engage in conflict. They may have difficulty asserting themselves and struggle with expressing feelings of anger or resentment. Ideally, they want to be cooperative and accommodate others, and may find themselves taken advantage of if their partners are not sensitive to their needs.</p>

<p>Artists are tolerant and uncritical, and adapt easily to their surroundings. They like to go with the flow and enjoy life from moment to moment. An ideal mate for an Artist takes the time to show spontaneous gestures of affection, and appreciates the Artist’s kind and helpful nature.</p>

<p>As parents, Artists are warm and sensitive, and take joy in creating comfort and stability in their homes. Artists are attentive to their children&rsquo;s practical needs and step in quickly and gracefully to provide for them. They often enjoy caring for children, but can sometimes become overworked and exhausted because of their natural impulse to help.</p>

<p>Artist parents often seem calm and unflappable. Artists are private people and can be reserved or remote, so their children may not always grasp the depth of the Artist parent&rsquo;s devotion to family. Although it is not often conspicuous, Artists have a deep loyalty to their loved ones. They value their intimate connections above all else and are tremendously dedicated to the care of their children.</p>
