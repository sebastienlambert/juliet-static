    <h1 class="title"> Guardian </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Guardians are industrious caretakers, loyal to traditions and organizations. They are practical, compassionate, and caring, and are motivated to provide for others and protect them from the perils of life.</p>

<p>Guardians are conventional and grounded, and enjoy contributing to established structures of society. They are steady and committed workers with a deep sense of responsibility to others. They focus on fulfilling their duties, particularly when they are taking care of the needs of other people. They want others to know that they are reliable and can be trusted to do what is expected of them. They are conscientious and methodical, and persist until the job is done.</p>

<p>Guardians are driven by their personal values, and are conscientious in their behavior. They typically want to work hard, get along with others, and make sure they do what is expected of them.</p>

<p>Guardians value relationships highly and strive to cooperate and maintain harmony with others. They want stability and longevity in their relationships, and tend to maintain a deep devotion to family. They feel most connected with people they know they can rely upon over the long term.</p>

<p>Guardians appreciate tradition and like knowing how things were done in the past. They are loyal to established methods and values, and want to observe the proper, accepted way of doing things. They place great importance on fitting in with established institutions and contributing what they can to maintain strong, stable social structures. In groups, they often take on the role of historian, ensuring that new members respect and value the established customs.</p>

<p>Guardians are characteristically humble and unassuming, and rarely call attention to themselves. They can often be found offering assistance to others in a modest, understated way. They are loyal and hardworking, and often commit themselves to tasks and projects with the aim of being helpful to their families, friends, and communities. They are typically involved in social groups, but do not want the spotlight: they are more likely to be found behind the scenes, working diligently to fulfill their role.</p>

<p>Guardians are oriented to relationships, but can be reserved with new people. They rarely disclose personal information quickly. They tend to be focused and aware of their surroundings, and relate details from their own personal experience. They often converse in terms of what has happened to them and what they have seen first-hand. They are compassionate listeners, and typically remember details about people. They often enjoy hearing the facts about others in the process of making a connection.</p>

<p>Guardians take a supportive role in communication, listening to tune into the needs of others. They tend to be sensitive and want to collaborate to support everyone involved. Guardians rarely demand the floor, but are often quietly taking in detailed information from the world around them. They contribute information when they see a practical use for it or when they see that it could be helpful. Guardians are loyal to what they see first-hand, and will often share perspectives based on personal experience.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Guardian is generous, accomodating, and loyal. Guardians are dedicated to the task of taking care of their loved ones, and take their family responsibilities seriously. They look for ways to provide and to assist, and are attentive to the details of the people around them.</p>

<p>Guardians appreciate history and tradition, and often want to create a relationship that reflects traditional ideals. Whether male or female, the Guardian typically adheres to customary gender roles, and dutifully takes on the corresponding household duties.</p>

<p>Guardians are motivated to help, and may put their partner’s needs ahead of their own. They typically have a clear idea of what a partner &ldquo;should&rdquo; do, but are not likely to be outwardly demanding when it comes to their own needs. They prize harmony and will often withdraw rather than engage in conflict.</p>

<p>Guardians want a relationship that allows them to be helpful and dutiful in their devotion to loved ones. They appreciate a considerate and thoughtful partner who recognizes their dedication and ability to nurture others.</p>

<p>As parents, Guardians are devoted, traditional, and responsible. They are often firm but loving disciplinarians, and want to teach their children to do the right thing and adhere to the rules of society.</p>

<p>Guardian parents can be overprotective in their motivation to shield their children from the dangers of life, and may blame themselves for problems that their children experience, feeling that they didn’t work hard enough as parents. Guardians are nurturing and practical, and typically excellent at providing for their children’s daily needs.</p>
