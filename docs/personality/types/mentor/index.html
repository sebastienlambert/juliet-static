    <h1 class="title"> Mentor </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Mentors are creative nurturers with a strong sense of personal integrity and a drive to help others realize their potential. Creative and dedicated, they have a talent for helping others with original solutions to their personal challenges.</p>

<p>The Counselor has a unique ability to intuit others&rsquo; emotions and motivations, and will often know how someone else is feeling before that person knows it himself. They trust their insights about others and have strong faith in their ability to read people. Although they are sensitive, they are also reserved; the Mentor is a private sort, and is selective about sharing intimate thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>Mentors are guided by a deeply considered set of personal values. They are intensely idealistic, and can clearly imagine a happier and more perfect future. They can become discouraged by the harsh realities of the present, but they are typically motivated and persistent in taking positive action nonetheless. The Mentor feels an intrinsic drive to do what they can to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>Mentors want a meaningful life and deep connections with other people. They do not tend to share themselves freely but appreciate emotional intimacy with a select, committed few. Although their rich inner life can sometimes make them seem mysterious or private to others, they profoundly value authentic connections with people they trust.</p>

<p>Mentors often appear quiet, caring and sensitive, and may be found listening attentively to someone else’s ideas or concerns. They are highly perceptive about people and want to help others achieve understanding. Mentors are not afraid of complex personal problems; in fact, they are quite complex themselves, and have a rich inner life that few are privy to. They reflect at length on issues of ethics, and feel things deeply. Because Counselors initially appear so gentle and reserved, they may surprise others with their intensity when one of their values is threatened or called into question. Their calm exterior belies the complexity of their inner worlds.</p>

<p>Because Mentors are such complex people, they may be reluctant to engage with others who might not understand or appreciate them, and can thus be hard to get to know. Although they want to get along with others and support them in their goals, they are fiercely loyal to their own system of values and will not follow others down a path that does not feel authentic to them. When they sense that their values are not being respected, or when their intuition tells them that someone’s intentions are not pure, they are likely to withdraw.</p>

<p>Mentors are reserved about communication, and often keep their most treasured ideas and insights private. They are oriented to values and connection, and will search for meaning in the information they take in. They think deeply and often need time to process and evaluate before they are ready to share their ideas. They seek validation and will take the time to appreciate others and their ideas. They are often talented at making connections to bring people together and integrate ideas, values, and human potential.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Mentor is supportive and guided by a sense of integrity. The Mentor&rsquo;s interest in human development applies to their mates as well, and they are encouraging of their partner&rsquo;s dreams, aspirations, and achievements.</p>

<p>Mentors want to maintain harmony in their relationships and are highly motivated to resolve conflicts. They tend to be creative problem-solvers and look for the emotional core of an issue to create a meeting of the minds. Although they desire cooperation, they are not willing to go along with an idea that does not feel authentic to them. When it comes to their core values and ethics, they are unwilling to compromise.</p>

<p>Mentors want a high degree of intimacy and emotional engagement, and are happiest when they feel they are sharing their innermost thoughts and feelings with their mates. Mentors value a partner who respects their deeply held values and ethics, and one who appreciates their creativity and inspiration.</p>

<p>As parents, Mentors are devoted and loving. They tend to form strong bonds with their children and are very closely tuned in to their emotional states. Counselor parents naturally see the possibilities in their children and encourage them to develop their potential.</p>

<p>Although they support their children in their individual interests, Mentor parents are firm disciplinarians, particularly when it comes to moral or ethical concerns. They are concerned with their children&rsquo;s emotional health and spiritual development, and want to create a nurturing atmosphere that promotes growth and well-being.</p>
