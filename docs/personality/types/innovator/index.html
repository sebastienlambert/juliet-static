    <h1 class="title"> Innovator </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Innovators are inspired innovators, motivated to find new solutions to intellectually challenging problems. They are curious and clever, and seek to comprehend the people, systems, and principles that surround them. Open-minded and unconventional, Visionaries want to analyze, understand, and influence other people.</p>

<p>Innovators enjoy playing with ideas and especially like to banter with others. They use their quick wit and command of language to keep the upper hand with other people, often cheerfully poking fun at their habits and eccentricities. While the Innovator enjoys challenging others, in the end they are usually happy to live and let live. They are rarely judgmental, but they may have little patience for people who can&rsquo;t keep up.</p>

<p>Innovators are energized by challenge and are often inspired by a problem that others perceive as impossible to solve. They are confident in their ability to think creatively, and may assume that others are too tied to tradition to see a new way. The Visionary relies on their ingenuity to deal with the world around them, and rarely finds preparation necessary. They will often jump into a new situation and trust themselves to adapt as they go.</p>

<p>Innovators are masters of re-inventing the wheel and often refuse to do a task the same way twice. They question norms and often ignore them altogether. Established procedures are uninspiring to the Visionary, who would much rather try a new method (or two) than go along with the standard.</p>

<p>Innovators are typically friendly and often charming. They usually want to be seen as clever and may try to impress others with their quick wit and incisive humor. They are curious about the world around them, and want to know how things work. However, for the Innovator, the rules of the universe are made to be broken. They like to find the loopholes and figure out how they can work the system to their advantage. This is not to say the Visionary is malicious: they simply find rules limiting, and believe there is probably a better, faster, or more interesting way to do things that hasn’t been thought of before.</p>

<p>The Innovator is characteristically entrepreneurial and may be quick to share a new business idea or invention. They are confident and creative, and typically excited to discuss their many ingenious ideas. The Innovator’s enthusiasm for innovation is infectious, and they are often good at getting other people on board with their schemes. However, they are fundamentally “big-picture” people, and may be at a loss when it comes to recalling or describing details. They are typically more excited about exploring a concept than they are about making it reality, and can seem unreliable if they don’t follow through with their many ideas.</p>

<p>Innovators are lively and agile communicators who speak in terms of the “big idea.” They like to explore possibilities and make connections with the information they receive. Innovators love innovative solutions and are enthusiastic about change, but they are also highly analytical and will not hesitate to criticize ideas that don’t hold up to their logical analysis. Innovators can be hard to keep up with in conversation; they like to play with lots of complex ideas and have little patience for explaining details.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Innovator is inventive, enthusiastic, and spontaneous. Innovators are often exciting partners, full of ideas for new things to explore together.</p>

<p>Innovators prize their ability to understand others and communicate effectively, and have an ongoing interest in improving themselves and their relationships. They want to know how their partners&rsquo; minds work, and are creative in coming up with solutions to interpersonal problems.</p>

<p>Innovators like to encourage their mates to pursue their ambitions. However, they may be competitive or even argumentative; they enjoy a good debate for its own sake. They typically need a partner who is emotionally resilient and doesn&rsquo;t take offense at their intellectual challenges.</p>

<p>Innovators can be unreliable as they follow their inspiration, wherever it may lead. They have little interest in order or routine, and may neglect mundane household chores as they pursue more stimulating activities. The ideal mate for an Innovator appreciates their ingenuity, competence, and perceptiveness, and supports them in their ever-changing interests, schemes, and social pursuits.</p>

<p>As parents, Innovators are concerned with developing their children as independent thinkers. They are fun-loving parents who want to give their children many experiences to help their young minds expand and grow. More interested in challenging their children intellectually than caring for their physical needs, the Innovator is inclined to leave the day-to-day details of childrearing up to another parent if possible.</p>

<p>Although Innovator parents may be distracted from their families when other interests capture their attention, they derive great joy from offering their children many and varied opportunities to develop.</p>
