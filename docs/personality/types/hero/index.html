    <h1 class="title"> Hero </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>Heroes are idealist organizers, driven to implement their vision of what is best for humanity. They often act as catalysts for human growth because of their ability to see potential in other people and their charisma in persuading others to their ideas. They are focused on values and vision, and are passionate about the possibilities for people.</p>

<p>Heroes are typically energetic and driven, and often have a lot on their plates. They are tuned into the needs of others and acutely aware of human suffering; however, they also tend to be optimistic and forward-thinking, intuitively seeing opportunity for improvement. The Hero is ambitious, but their ambition is not self-serving: rather, they feel personally responsible for making the world a better place.</p>

<p>Heroes are driven by a deep sense of altruism and empathy for other people. They have an intuitive sense of the emotions of others, and often act as an emotional barometer for the people around them. However, their compassion not reserved for the people close to them: they are often humanitarian in nature, and may feel genuine concern for the ills of the entire human race. They tend to personally experience the feelings of others, and feel compelled to act when they see people suffering.</p>

<p>Heroes want close, supportive connections with others, and believe that cooperation is the best way to get things done. They like to be liked and are very sensitive to feedback, both positive and negative. They expect the best not just from themselves, but from others as well, and may find themselves disappointed when others are not as genuine in their intentions as the Hero. Heroes work hard to maintain strong relationships, and strive to be valuable members of their families, groups, and communities.</p>

<p>Heroes are natural teachers, often found organizing people to take part in some educational activity. They tend to take charge of a situation, and guide a group towards those activities and experiences which will help them learn and grow. They intuitively see the potential in people, and with charisma and warmth, they encourage others to pursue greater development of their strengths. They are typically dynamic and productive, and are often visibly energized when leading others to discover new knowledge.</p>

<p>Heroes are typically good communicators, talented at using words to connect with others. They are perceptive about people and enjoy talking about relationships. They often enjoy helping others solve personal problems and like to share their insights about people, their emotions, and their motivations. They are empathetic sometimes to the point of being overinvolved, and can become exhausted if they are surrounded by too much negative emotion.</p>

<p>Heroes are warm, compassionate communicators who show enthusiasm for other people and their ideas. They want to understand what is important to others so that they can take action to improve the situation for all involved. Heroes readily give affirmation and support, making sure that people know that their ideas are valued. They are good at connecting with a variety of people and creative in coming up with solutions that accommodate others’ needs. They are often natural teachers and mentors, showing others the way and helping them to improve themselves.</p>

<p>In relationships, the Hero is helpful and enthusiastically supportive. They are motivated to understand their partners and to do what pleases them, and are sensitive the the emotions and reactions of their mates.</p>

<p>Heroes make great cheerleaders, and will encourage their partners to develop and explore their potential. They are engaged and ready to help, and look for opportunities to support their mates in their accomplishments.</p>

<p>Hero partners want harmony above all else, sometimes at the expense of their own needs. Conflict is upsetting to Heroes, and they often avoid it. Heroes are very sensitive to criticism and can become highly emotional and even punishing when their feelings are hurt. However, they have great insight about people, emotions and motivations; they are often able to put this talent to use in resolving things.</p>

<p>The ideal mate for an Hero appreciates their compassion, support, and dedication to helping others, and makes an effort to understand the Hero&rsquo;s feelings and values.</p>

<p>As parents, Heroes take an active and enthusiastic role in guiding the development of their children. They enjoy teaching their children the ways of the world, and set forth clear ideas of right and wrong in a warm and supportive way.</p>

<p>Heroes have high expectations for their children, and often envision bright futures for them. They have an interest in their children&rsquo;s potential and want to inspire them to develop it. They can sometimes idealize their children, becoming disappointed when they don&rsquo;t live up to expectations. They may take their children&rsquo;s misbehavior personally, feeling that they have failed to instill their own strong values.</p>
